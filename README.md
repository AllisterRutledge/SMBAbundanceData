# SMBAbundanceData
Reads an abundance data excel file and creates or updates an existing abundance data excel file.

Things to rememember:
  
  -file must be kept in the same folder/directory as occupancy and abundace data you want it to read and write (it only looks at files in the same folder as itself).
  
  -it only copies over data from occupancy that has nothing in the "Proofed by" column.

Repository intended for use by LSU Secretive Marsh Bird research project to allow increase accuracy and speed of data entry.
